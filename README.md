# Ferdle

iMessage extension wrapper for the daily Wordle puzzle, that NYT surprisingly hasn't made already.

## How It Works

Fetches the daily solution from the unofficial NYT Wordle v2 JSON endpoint:
```
https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/YYYY-MM-DD.json
```

**Note:** This uses an unofficial API endpoint and is for educational purposes only.
